# Vocal Mirror Playback Interruption - Final Implementation

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### Issue 1: Hardcoded vs. Configurable Thresholds  
**Problem**: The implementation ignored the user's configurable "Silence Level" slider and used hardcoded values instead.

**Solution**: Now uses the user's configurable `silenceThreshold` consistently for both initial listening and playback interruption, providing predictable behavior.

### Issue 2: No Simultaneous Playback + Listening
**Problem**: `doTriggerPlayback()` stopped the recorder, preventing interruption detection during playback.

**Solution**: Recorder now stays active during playback, enabling real-time interruption detection.

## Final Implementation

### Threshold Usage
- **All States**: Use the same user-configurable threshold from the "Silence Level" slider
- **Consistent Behavior**: If speech is loud enough to start recording, it's loud enough to interrupt playback
- **User Control**: Fully adjustable from -70dB to -20dB via UI slider

### Simultaneous Recording + Playback
- **During Playback**: Microphone stays active to detect user speech
- **Interruption Detection**: Any speech above the configured threshold immediately stops playback
- **Seamless Transition**: Interrupted playback immediately starts new listening cycle

## Key Code Changes

### VocalMirror.ts - handleAudioData():
```typescript
} else if (this.state === 'playing') {
  // During playback, listen for interruption using the same threshold as initial listening
  // This ensures consistent sensitivity - if it was loud enough to start recording,
  // it's loud enough to interrupt playback
  if (isAboveThreshold) {
    // User spoke - interrupt playback and start new listening cycle
    this.playback?.stop();
    this.autoStartListening();
  }
}
```

### VocalMirror.ts - doTriggerPlayback():
```typescript
private async doTriggerPlayback(): Promise<void> {
  if ((this.buffer?.getDuration() || 0) === 0) return;
  
  // CRITICAL: DON'T stop recording - we need continuous microphone input during playback
  // This enables real-time interruption detection when user speaks during playback
  const audioData = this.buffer!.getAllData();
  const sampleRate = this.recorder!.getSampleRate();
  
  this.setState('playing');
  const started = await this.playback!.playAudio(audioData, sampleRate);
  if (!started) this.setState('ready');
}
```

## Testing & Verification

### Test Coverage
- **35 tests passing** ✅
- **Interruption Tests**: Verify speech above threshold interrupts playback
- **Threshold Tests**: Verify speech below threshold does NOT interrupt
- **State Flow Tests**: Verify proper transitions through all states

### User Experience
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: User controls via "Silence Level" slider (-70 to -20 dB)
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same threshold for starting recording and interrupting playback  
- **Real-time Feedback**: Volume meter shows current levels during both listening and recording
- **Seamless Interruption**: Speak during playback to immediately start new recording cycle

## Architecture Benefits

### Simplified Threshold Management
- Single configurable threshold eliminates confusion
- Predictable behavior across all states
- User has full control over sensitivity

### True Simultaneous Operation
- Recorder and playback operate concurrently during Playing state
- Real-time audio analysis continues throughout the entire cycle
- Instant interruption response with no latency

### Clean State Machine
- Four clear states: Ready → Listening → Recording → Playing
- Consistent audio processing across all active states  
- Graceful error handling and recovery

The app now provides the intended experience: speak during playback at normal volume to immediately interrupt and start a new recording cycle, with full user control over sensitivity settings.
